# Occupation Correlation Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing the correlations between professional categories and various other factors such as education, gender, sleep quality, and anxiety. This analysis is part of a research study conducted in the lab of Prof. Yaniv Assaf.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how different professional categories relate to other aspects of participants' lives. Each notebook focuses on analyzing a specific correlation:

- **Occupation And Education.ipynb**: Examines the relationship between the occupation category and participants' education levels.
- **Occupation And Anxiety.ipynb**: Investigates the correlation between occupation and anxiety levels.
- **Occupation And Gender.ipynb**: Analyzes gender distribution across different occupations.
- **Occupation And Sleep.ipynb**: Studies the impact of occupation on participants' sleep quality.

## Repository Structure

- `Occupation And Education.ipynb`: Correlation between occupation and education.
- `Occupation And Anxiety.ipynb`: Correlation between occupation and anxiety.
- `Occupation And Gender.ipynb`: Correlation between occupation and gender.
- `Occupation And Sleep.ipynb`: Correlation between occupation and sleep quality.
